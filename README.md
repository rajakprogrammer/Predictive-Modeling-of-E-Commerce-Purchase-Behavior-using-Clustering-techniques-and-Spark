The ever-growing scale of e-commerce has caused
 enormous quantities of records, necessitating advanced strate
gies for extracting actionable insights into patron conduct.
 This challenge makes a speciality of predictive modeling of e
commerce buy behavior the use of clustering strategies and
 Spark’s allotted data processing framework. The technique
 integrates Spark’s in-memory computing with superior clustering
 algorithms, along with K-Means, K-Means++, and Gaussian
 Mixture Model (GMM). By reducing functions, handling lacking
 values, and imposing the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
 version, this method segments customers effectively. A compar
ative evaluation is achieved among Spark-based and non-Spark
primarily based methodologies to assess scalability, performance,
 and accuracy. The integration of Spark ensures fault tolerance,
 parallel processing, and improved clustering performance, opti
mizing consumer insights and enterprise techniques.
